# freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design - Tribute Page

This repo is intended to make the code used for the tribute page project of the responsive web design certification in freeCodeCamp publicly available (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page).

It is aiming for a pure HTML/CSS implementation.
